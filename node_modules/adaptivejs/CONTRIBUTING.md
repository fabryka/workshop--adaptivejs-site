## Coding Guidelines

The following section sets out some guidelines for code being submitted to Adaptive.js. These are not hard-and-fast rules but rather guidelines that help to make for a consistent and easy-to-learn codebase.

### Grunt tasks

Part of the Adaptive.js framework is a series of [Grunt](http://gruntjs.com) tasks. When contributing improvements or new tasks, please familiarize yourself with our existing tasks for best practices and conventions. When possible, add a task description with any possible options your task may consume - these are shown via the `grunt --help` task.


### JavaScript

[Mobify JavaScript Code Style Guidelines](https://github.com/mobify/mobify-code-style/tree/master/javascript)

JS can be manually run through our code style linter (jscs/jshint) with the command `grunt lint`. Please note that JS will be linted automatically during each build.
