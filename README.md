#Adaptive.js Workshop

The example site for this workshop is [Merlin's Potions](http://www.merlinspotions.com), a mock e-commerce site that peddles potions and spell books.

We use Git to switch between the steps in the workshop. Look through some of [Git's documentation](http://git-scm.com/documentation) if you're not already familiar with Git. Also, we use Require.js in most of the JavaScript files in the project. Its documentation is found [here](http://requirejs.org/docs/start.html).

Follow the installation steps in the **Workshop Pre-requisites** section below to get your computer ready for the workshop. Once you're done, follow the directions in the **Ready to Start** section.
