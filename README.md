#Adaptive.js Workshop

The example site for this workshop is [Merlin's Potions](http://www.merlinspotions.com), a mock e-commerce site that peddles potions and spell books.

We use [Git](http://git-scm.com/documentation) to check out the completed code base for the mobile site adaptation of Merlin's Potions. Also, we use [Require.js](http://requirejs.org/docs/start.html) in most of the JavaScript files in the project.
