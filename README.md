#Step 5: Style the header

Now that we've added content to the header, we need to style it. 

##Task

###Style the Header

1. Open the file `_header.scss` found under /assets/styles/templates/partials

    This file was generated by the Adaptive.js project generator with some default styles. We'll need to replace these with styles for our site's header.

2. Replace the file contents with the following:

    ![Header scss file](https://s3.amazonaws.com/uploads.hipchat.com/15359/64553/q7jP7cKRiw8Pxkc/Screen%20Shot%202015-01-19%20at%2010.16.38%20AM.png)

    We've got the header layout set up, but the menu and cart buttons aren't visible yet.

3. Create a new file called `_button.scss` in the folder /assets/styles/components
4. Add the following content to the file:

    ![Button scss file](https://s3.amazonaws.com/uploads.hipchat.com/15359/64553/q7jP7cKRiw8Pxkc/Screen%20Shot%202015-01-19%20at%2010.16.38%20AM.png)

5. Open the file `_components.scss` found under /assets/styles
6. Add the `_button scss` file to the list of components

    ![Components scss file](https://s3.amazonaws.com/uploads.hipchat.com/15359/64553/IY7nlEnEH3Kv1hx/Screen%20Shot%202015-01-19%20at%2010.17.55%20AM.png)

7. Repeat steps 3-6 to add another component called `_cart-count` with the following styles:

    ![Cart count scss file](https://s3.amazonaws.com/uploads.hipchat.com/15359/64553/6reMHyzH8L7Xc34/Screen%20Shot%202015-01-19%20at%2010.25.04%20AM.png)

8. Run `grunt preview`
9. View the mobile site in your browser

    Your header should look like this:
